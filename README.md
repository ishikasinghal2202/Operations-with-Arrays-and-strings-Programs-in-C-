AIM:

         To study and implement C++ Arrays and Strings


SOFTWARE USED: 

         VS Code


OBJECTIVE:

         - Develop strong control over data structures and memory
       - Practice using loops, decision-making, and functions
       - Build a foundation for problem-solving in competitive and real-world programming
       - Enhance debugging and code optimization skills


THEORY:

        Arrays and strings are foundational concepts in C++ programming that serve as essential tools for storing and managing data efficiently.
        Their study enables developers to write structured, performant code and lays the groundwork for more complex programming paradigms.

Arrays :

     An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. 
     Arrays allow for efficient storage, direct access using indices, and bulk processing of data through iteration.
     They are used in scenarios where fixed-size, indexable data structures are ideal.

Key Benefits:

          - Fast access to elements using indices
          - Simplified manipulation of multiple values with loops
          - A stepping stone to advanced concepts like pointers, dynamic memory, and data structures

Strings:

     In C++, strings are sequences of characters used to represent text.
     They can be managed as character arrays (`char[]`) or with the `std::string` class, each offering different levels of abstraction and control. Understanding strings is crucial for handling user input, file processing, and text manipulation.

Key Benefits:

      - Powerful means to process and manipulate textual data
      - Useful for building interactive applications
      - Often paired with functions and algorithms for tasks like searching, comparing, and formatting


SAMPLE OUTPUT :

         To print array elements:
                       Array elements are: 10 20 30 40 50 


         To find number in given array :
                       Enter number to search: 30
                       Found at index 2

         Sum and average of array elements:
                      Enter the numbers of the array:
                      1 2 4 5 6 7 
                      The numbers of the array are:
                      1 2 4 5 6 7 
                      The sum of the elements of the array is:
                      25
                      The average of the elements of the array is: 4.16667


         To find Minimum and maximum Number:
                     Enter the number of elements (1 to 100): 3
                     Enter 3 integers:
                     Enter element 1: 90
                     Enter element 2: 86
                     Enter element 3: 43
                     Minimum value: 43
                     Maximum value: 90

         Declaring & intitalising a string:
                    C-style string: Hello
                    C++ string 1: World
                    C++ string 2: Welcome
                    C++ string 3: World
                    C++ string 4: *****
                    C++ string 5: World to C++
                    C++ string 6: Learning C++ Strings


         Concatenation of strings: 
                    Enter first string: helloooo
                    Enter second string: cutuuuuuuuu
                    Concatenated string: helloooo cutuuuuuuuu

         Printing string in reverse:
                    dlroW olleH

         Palindrome checking:
                    Enter a string: Dad
                    Not a palindrome.
         

CONCLUSION:

          Together, arrays and strings fuel the majority of core programming tasks and support a deeper understanding of how data is represented and manipulated in C++.
